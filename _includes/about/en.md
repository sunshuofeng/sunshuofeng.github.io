Hello, everyone. My name is sun suifeng. I am a sophomore majoring in intelligent science and technology in xidian university.

My home is in guangzhou, so I'm from fujian. Go to xi 'an looking for food, but the school is far from the city center, traffic is inconvenient, can only eat dirt in the school every day.



I like to play games (king of glory, league of legends, cf), play ball, code (although nothing has been coded), watch TV, watch movies, and watch TV.



Back to the original intention of setting up a blog, in order to record what deeplearning sees and hears in the future, so the blog is still mainly professional related blog, of course, may also write some life blog in the future (don't be lazy to write).



If you would like to play games and discuss some knowledge of deeplearning CV, please contact me in the following way.
